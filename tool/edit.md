# Editor or IDE

Your text editor or IDE is where you'll be doing all your work day in and day out and there are many great choices.

- Visual Studio Code
- Atom
- Jetbrains (different ones depending on the language)

I primarily use VSCode so here are several videos on making best use of Visual Studio Code.
