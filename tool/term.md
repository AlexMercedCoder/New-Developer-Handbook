## Terminal/Bash/Zsh

The terminal is going to be the main way to communicate with your computer for a lot of tasks. Especially important when most server computers don't have graphical interfaces leaving terminal/shell commands as the only to interact with the server (keep in mind MOST web servers are linux based).

- The default shell on linux is Bash
- The default shell on mac is Zsh (which works exactly like bash)
- The default shell on windows is CMD/Powershell (very different, recommended you download "Git-Bash" to get familiar with bash commands)

Regardless which operating system your on, a smart move is to install starship.rs to make your prompt (the text before where you type commands) more informative.
