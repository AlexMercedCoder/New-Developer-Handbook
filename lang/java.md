# Java

One of the most popular languages of all time. Made popular for its "write once run anywhere" mantra. Instead of compiling multiple times for multiple operating systems code compiled into bytecode that is run by the Java Virtual Machine that can run on any operating system. Now there are several languages that compile into Java bytecode such as Scala, Groovy, Kotlin, Clojure, and Ballerina.
