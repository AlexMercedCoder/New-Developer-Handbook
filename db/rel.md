## Relational/SQL Databases

Relational databases:

- keep track of data in a structure very similar to a spreadsheet in columns and rows.
- A column is a field/property representing one charchteristic of the data model (name, age)
- A row is a record that is only entry (Name: Spot, Age: 5)
- Relational Databases require a schema on write (you must define all the fields of the records before adding them)
- The equivalent of one spreadsheet is a table
- every record on one table should have a unique identifier called a "primary key"
- records in one table can be related to records in another table (person is related to a dog)
- Operations in Relational databases almost always uses SQL (structured query language)

## Relational Databases

While all these databases share SQL as a common language for retrieving, create, updating data, how they implement SQL differs meaning some minor differences along with different performance considerations.

- Postgres
- MySQL
- SQLite3
- Maria DB
- Oracle
- MSSQL

## Learning SQL
SQL is a force to be reckoned with as it has sneaked beyond relational databases to other types of databases with tools like Dremio and Apache Drill. You can never know SQL well enough for todays analytical needs.
