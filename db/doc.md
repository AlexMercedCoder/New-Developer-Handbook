## Document Databases

Document databases allow the writing on unstructured data, meaning there is no schema enforced when the data is written to the database.

- Instead of tables, DocDBs have collections
- Instead of records, DocDBs have documents
- Instead of columns/fields, each document has several properties

Schemas can be enforced when reading the data in some DocDBs, this is known as Schema-on-read.
