### By Alex Merced (AlexMercedCoder.com)

This guide is to help new developers find "getting started" information and helpful tips and troubleshooting guidance. There are three main sections.

**Getting Started Reading**
- [How to become a Developer](https://tuts.alexmercedcoder.com/2022/1/becoming_a_developer_in_2022/)
- [Developing your Developer Brand](https://tuts.alexmercedcoder.com/2020/branding/)

## HTML & CSS

Regardless what type of development you plan on getting into, some understanding of HTML and CSS matter as they are the main ingredients in the interfaces or "front end" of most modern applications regardless of medium (desktop/web/mobile) and regardless of the language the guts or "backend" is created with.

## Languages

Each of these guides will provide information on install, learning and understanding the ecosystem of the language.

- [Javascript](./lang/js.md)
- [Python](./lang/py.md)

- [PHP](./lang/php.md)
- [Go](./lang/go.md)
- [Rust](./lang/rust.md)

## Tools

Just as important as knowing a programming language is knowing the tools  of the trade. Terminals, IDEs, Version Control and more. You need to get comfortable with these tools.

- [IDE/Editor](./tool/edit.md)
- [Bash/Terminal](./tool/term.md)
- [Git/Version Control](./tool/git.md)

## Databases

Your applications needs to store data somewhere so knowing about different types of databases, how they work and how they scale will be integral to your success.

- [Relational/SQL Databases](./db/rel.md)
- [Document/noSQL Databases](./db/doc.md)
- [Graph Databases](./db/graph.md)

## Computer Science

To take your skills to the next level you really need to understand how a computer works and the protocols that allow them to communicate. Understanding how computer memory works and the role of data structures, algorithms and design patterns will enable you to create more efficient and maintainable applications.
