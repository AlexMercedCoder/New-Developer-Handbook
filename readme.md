## HTML & CSS

Regardless what type of development you plan on getting into, some understanding of HTML and CSS matter as they are the main ingredients in the interfaces or "front end" of most modern applications regardless of medium (desktop/web/mobile) and regardless of the language the guts or "backend" is created with.

## Computer Science

To take your skills to the next level you really need to understand how a computer works and the protocols that allow them to communicate. Understanding how computer memory works and the role of data structures, algorithms and design patterns will enable you to create more efficient and maintainable applications.
